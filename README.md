# Exercise: Bookstore Manager

Application Structure:
- Two Functional Components: One with useCallback and one without it.
- Console Logging: Each component will have a function that logs a message to the console. This will help students observe how often the function is recreated.
- Toggle Theme Button: A button to toggle a theme (e.g., light/dark), allowing students to see the effect of state changes on the components.



Setup the React App:

- Use create-react-app to set up a new React project.
- Create Two Components:
    - WithUseCallback: This component will use the useCallback hook for its function.
    - WithoutUseCallback: This component will not use useCallback.
